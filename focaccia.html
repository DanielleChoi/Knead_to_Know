<p class ="focaccia_text">You are a welcoming, hospitable friend who knows how to make everyone feel at home. With its soft, pillowy interior and golden, herb-infused crust, 
  you invite others in and make others feel at ease. You are full of flavor, often studded with rosemary, olives, or garlic, and you love to share. 
  You fill the room with warmth and comfort, much like a big family dinner or a cozy get-together. You aren’t afraid of being a little bold in flavor, 
  but you are never too much—it’s the perfect balance of savory and soft. Whether served as an appetizer or as part of a meal, you are a friend who knows 
  how to make any moment feel special.

<p class = "white_text">You are VERY compatible with white, pita, baguette and sourdough. You are NOT compatible with rye.</p>
