<p class ="white_text">You are the deep thinker of the bread world. It has a rich, earthy flavor, a bit tangy, and sometimes with a touch of sweetness. 
    Rye is a little reserved and not overly flashy, but there’s an old-world wisdom about it. It has a long history—dating back centuries in European countries like 
    Russia, Germany, and Poland—giving it an air of heritage and tradition. It’s a bread that you can rely on for stability and depth, not someone who’s just here for 
    a quick thrill. Rye is often paired with hearty meals or cold cuts, making it the perfect companion for someone who enjoys a good, intellectual conversation or a quiet, 
    cozy night with a good book. It doesn’t mind being a little niche, finding pride in its unique flavor.
