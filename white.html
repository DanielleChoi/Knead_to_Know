<p class ="white_text">You are the familiar, dependable friend. It’s the one you’ve known since childhood, always there when you need it, no matter the occasion. 
    Soft, simple, and unpretentious, you're comforting and easygoing. You don't try to be anything more than what you are —a straightforward, classic choice. 
    There’s something heartwarming about a fresh slice of white bread, maybe with some butter or jam, that takes you back to simpler times. 
    It's not fancy, but it’s reliable, and that’s exactly why you always return to it. You have have no need for complexity; you find joy in the basic, everyday moments.
