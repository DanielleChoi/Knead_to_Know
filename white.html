<p class ="white_text">White bread is the familiar, dependable friend. It’s the one you’ve known since childhood, always there when you need it, no matter the occasion. 
    Soft, simple, and unpretentious, white bread is comforting and easygoing. It doesn’t try to be anything more than what it is—a straightforward, classic choice. 
    There’s something heartwarming about a fresh slice of white bread, maybe with some butter or jam, that takes you back to simpler times. 
    It's not fancy, but it’s reliable, and that’s exactly why you always return to it. White bread has no need for complexity; it finds joy in the basic, everyday moments.
