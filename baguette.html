<p class ="white_text">You are the life of the party, the one who’s always polished and effortlessly cool. You're sleek, crispy on the outside, 
    soft on the inside, and universally loved—whether you're in a Parisian café or a bustling street in New York. You have a certain “je ne sais quoi”
     about it, always dressed to impress and with a touch of elegance. You're the kind of bread you can toss under your arm while strolling through the 
     city or share with a group of friends over some cheese and wine. You're well-traveled and cosmopolitan, always ready for the next adventure, 
     but you've got a humble, down-to-earth soul. Beneath the golden crust, your reliable and uncomplicated—just pure, delightful flavor.
