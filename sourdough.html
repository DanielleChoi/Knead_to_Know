<p class ="white_text">You are the philosopher—the one who’s had time to develop wisdom, often more than you might expect at first glance. With its tangy, slightly sour 
    flavor and chewy texture, sourdough is a bit quirky, perhaps a little more high-maintenance than others. It’s the result of patience, time, and nurturing—just like a good 
    conversation with someone who’s well-read and thoughtful. This bread has deep roots, with origins in ancient Egypt, and it thrives on its own natural process. Sourdough is 
    not easily rushed, and it’s best enjoyed when you’ve taken the time to appreciate its complexities. It’s a bread for those who savor life slowly, who find beauty in the unrefined.
