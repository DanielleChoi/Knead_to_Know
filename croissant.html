<p class ="white_text">You are the free-spirited artist, a dreamer with a penchant for luxury. Flaky, buttery, and soft, it’s the bread you crave when you want to treat 
    yourself. Its layers are like dreams, rich and full of possibility, with an air of elegance and decadence. The croissant has a certain sophisticated charm but also a carefree 
    vibe—whether it’s at a Parisian café or paired with a morning espresso. It doesn’t like to be rushed, and it’s often found in the quiet moments of the morning, basking in the 
    soft glow of sunlight. The croissant is a bread that doesn’t worry too much about the grind—it’s more about savoring life, even if just for a brief, flaky moment.
